## What BioRSP Tests

BioRSP quantifies the directional enrichment of gene expression within low-dimensional cell embeddings (e.g., UMAP, t-SNE). It tests the hypothesis that a gene's expression is not uniformly distributed around a central vantage point but is significantly skewed towards a specific angular sector. By combining radial density scanning with rigorous permutation testing and graph-based autocorrelation (Moran's I), BioRSP distinguishes true biological gradients from random embedding artifacts, providing a robust metric ($E_{max}$) and direction ($\phi_{max}$) for identifying spatially polarized biological processes.
